== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who can see Note Press? =

At this time, only the Super Admin has the ability to use Note Press.

= Can the icons be replaced? =

Yes. The icons are stored in the Note_Press/public/icons directory.  To add your own custom icons, simply upload them to that directory and Note Press will find them. Be aware that Note Press is designed for 16x16 icons.  Using icons of any other size will produce unpredictable results.

= What does the search look for? =

Note Press has the ability to search through your notes.  When doing so, it checks for matches in both the title and the contents of the note.  The search is not case-sensitive.

= How many notes can Note Press hold? =

To the limit of your database. Only 5 notes will be displayed in the list at a time though.

= Can media be stored in the notes? =

Yes. Note Press uses the same editor (Tiny MCE) used when creating posts and pages.

= Can shortcodes be used in the notes? =

Yes. Although not all shortcodes have been tested, Note Press does process the contents of your notes for shortcodes.
